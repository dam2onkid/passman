# File Organization Standards

## Component Directory Structure
```
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
├── components/            # Shared components
│   ├── ui/               # Basic UI components
│   └── features/         # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/                # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                  # Utility functions and configurations
└── constants/           # Application constants
```

## Naming Conventions
1. Files:
   - React Components: PascalCase (e.g., `Button.jsx`, `UserProfile.jsx`)
   - Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useAuth.js`, `useForm.js`)
   - Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.js`, `validation.js`)
   - Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_ENDPOINTS.js`)

2. Directories:
   - All directories should use kebab-case
   - Feature directories should be descriptive and domain-specific

## Import/Export Guidelines
1. Use named exports for utilities and components
2. Use index files for cleaner imports
3. Group imports by:
   - External dependencies
   - Internal components/hooks
   - Styles and types
   - Constants
