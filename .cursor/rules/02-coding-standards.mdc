# Coding Standards

## Component Structure
1. Use functional components with hooks
2. Follow the component naming convention:
   - Components should be PascalCase
   - Files should match their component names
   - Place components in appropriate directories based on their scope

## Styling Guidelines
1. Use Tailwind CSS classes exclusively for styling
2. Prefer `class:` syntax over ternary operators for conditional classes
3. Follow mobile-first responsive design principles
4. Use Shadcn UI components when available

## JavaScript/TypeScript Practices
1. Use early returns to reduce nesting and improve readability
2. Event handler functions should be prefixed with "handle"
   Example: `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`, `handleKeyDown`
3. Use descriptive variable and function names
4. Implement proper error handling and loading states

## State Management
1. Use React hooks for local state
2. Implement Zustand for global state management
3. Keep state logic separated in custom hooks when complex

## Performance
1. Implement proper component memoization when needed
2. Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
3. Implement proper loading and error states
4. Use dynamic imports for code splitting when appropriate
